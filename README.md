Every player is both a gamer and a potential co-founder — every victory leads to **real-world ownership**.

| Element | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🎮 **Game Objective** | Compete in strategic venture arenas and rise to become a **Star CEO**. |
| 💼 **Real Ventures** | Each game represents a **real African startup** idea voted on by the community. |
| 💰 **Ownership** | Winning players earn **20% CEO equity**, while all participants share the remaining 80%. |
| 🪙 **Star Tickets** | The entry mechanism — each ticket equals one participation slot per competition. |
| 🧠 **DAO Governance** | The community controls funding, policies, and expansion through **on-chain voting**. |

|------|---------|-------------|
| 🏆 **Winning Player** | 20% | Becomes CEO and gains operational control. |
| 👥 **All Participants** | 80% | Shared proportionally based on engagement and contribution. |

### **Star Ticket Model**
